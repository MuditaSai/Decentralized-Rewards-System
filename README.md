# Decentralized-Rewards-System

Our decentralized rewards system is a smart contract built on top of CMUâ€™s internal blockchain that will not only help track spending at each CMU dining location but also give meal rewards to students that are loyal to specific on-campus locations to drive student engagement with on-campus dining options. With a decentralized system, customers now have a multitude of options to choose from as well as the option to opt in/out from a particular service. Furthermore, using blockchain technology can remove the need for a paper-based system where coupons/rewards are handed out to the customer in-store (for ex. the rewards system at Millies). Instead, customers can easily carry out all these transactions via their phones and scan in their rewards which would then be stored in a unit of the blockchain that keeps track of all the information from all the dining locations.
